## Big Data
### Movie Recommendation System with PySpark
I designed a system that recommends movies based on user ratings and similarity between movie tags on the data of 20M ratings and 465K tag applications across 27K movies collected from activities on MovieLens. I performed ALS matrix factorization on the ratings data to estimate user ratings for unseen movies. Also, developed distance-based recommendation and recommendation-evaluation metric with the help of PCA to recommend movies based on previously liked movies.  <br/>

## Classification Problems
### Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!
This is a simple example of Logistic Regression Implementation using NumPy. It is based on Andrew Ng's Lecture on Coursera.
Halloween Special competition. We have some characteristics of monsters and the goal is to predict the type of monsters: ghouls, goblins or ghosts.

### Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition
The goal was to recognize digits 0 to 9 in handwriting images using K-NN, Naive Bayes Algorithm and Support Vector Machine. 

### [Student Performance Prediction](https://github.com/adesh-gadge/Student_Performance_Predictions) </br> 
Predicting students academic performance using various factors such as class participation, resources visited, subject, attendance., etc
There are three categories of student classes: High/H, Low/L and Medium/M based on academic performance.
A kaggle dataset on student academic performance (available through https://www.kaggle.com/aljarah/xAPI-Edu-Data and also included as the attachment in this instruction) is gathered to identify the influential factors for students’ performance.

### Handwritten Alphabet Recognizer with Keras
The data set comes from the Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition. The goal is to recognize digits 0 to 9 in
handwriting images.I have utilized naïve Bayes, kNN and SVM algorithms. Tuned their parameters to get the best model (measured by cross validation) and compared which algorithms provide better model for this task.
