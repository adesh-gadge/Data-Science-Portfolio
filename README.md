## Classification Problems
### Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!
This is a simple example of Logistic Regression Implementation using NumPy. It is based on Andrew Ng's Lecture on Coursera.
Halloween Special competition. We have some characteristics of monsters and the goal is to predict the type of monsters: ghouls, goblins or ghosts.

### Cluster Analysis(K-means, HAC) and Decision Tree Induction algorithm
Solving a mystery in history using Machine Learning with R: who wrote the disputed essays in the Federalist Papers, Hamilton or Madison?

### Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition
The goal was to recognize digits 0 to 9 in handwriting images using K-NN, Naive Bayes Algorithm and Support Vector Machine.

### Student Performance Prediction
A kaggle dataset on student academic performance (available through https://www.kaggle.com/aljarah/
xAPI-Edu-Data and also included as the attachment in this instruction) is gathered to identify the influential
factors for students’ performance. To predict the students’ performance, the collected data was organized into
four kinds of features: demographic, academic background, parents’ participation on learning process and
behavioral features. The demographic features consisted of demographic details of the students like gender,
nationality, place of birth etc. The section, grades and semester details of the students were included under
the academic features and behavioral features consisted of fields demonstrating students’ engagement with
the learning management system like viewed announcements, interaction with discussion groups, resources etc.
To analyze the students’ performance, the target “Class” attribute was discretized into orindal values based
upon students’ grades. Hence, we had three categories of student classes: High/H, Low/L and Medium/M.
