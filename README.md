## Classification Problems
### Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!
This is a simple example of Logistic Regression Implementation using NumPy. It is based on Andrew Ng's Lecture on Coursera.
Halloween Special competition. We have some characteristics of monsters and the goal is to predict the type of monsters: ghouls, goblins or ghosts.

### Cluster Analysis(K-means, HAC) and Decision Tree Induction algorithm
Solving a mystery in history using Machine Learning with R: who wrote the disputed essays in the Federalist Papers, Hamilton or Madison?

### Airline Customer Satisfaction Survey Analysis
Uncovering effects of features such as Age,Gender, Price Sensitivity,Food,Snacks or shopping on airports on the Custoemr Satisfaction on the flight journey using machine learning with R. 

### Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition
The goal was to recognize digits 0 to 9 in handwriting images using K-NN, Naive Bayes Algorithm and Support Vector Machine. 


## Regression Problems
