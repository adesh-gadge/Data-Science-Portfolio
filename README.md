## Big Data Projects
### Movie Recommendation System with PySpark
[Poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ExudTF-k-Ac8wRsWkK-V6a7DnSDy3spG/view?usp=sharing) <br/>
I designed a system that recommends movies based on user ratings and similarity between movie tags on the data of 20M ratings and 465K tag applications across 27K movies collected from activities on MovieLens. I performed ALS matrix factorization on the ratings data to estimate user ratings for unseen movies. Also, developed distance-based recommendation and recommendation-evaluation metric with the help of PCA to recommend movies based on previously liked movies.  


### Implementation of Bloom-Filter for filtering spam users
[Project Link](https://github.com/adesh-gadge/Bloom-Filter-Implimentation) </br>
A Bloom filter is a data structure designed to tell you, rapidly and memory-efficiently, whether an element is present in a set.
Bloom filter does not have False Negatives but does have False Positives due to collisions. </br>
Given data consists of two text files: (1) Username lists which are known to be spams & (2) General Username lists. </br>
Detect spam usernames in the (2) General usernames list

## Advance Neural Networks

### General Adversarial Networks with PyTorch to Create Anime Faces
[Project Link](https://jovian.ml/adesh-gadge/06b-anime-dcgan) </br>
The Anime Face Dataset from kaggle, which consists of over 63,000 cropped anime faces.
Trained two Neural Networks: a Generator and a Discriminator. The generator generates a "fake" sample given a random vector/matrix, and the discriminator attempts to detect whether a given sample is "real" (picked from the training data) or "fake" (generated by the generator). Training happens in tandem: we train the discriminator for a few epochs, then train the generator for a few epochs, and repeat. This way both the generator and the discriminator get better at doing their jobs. </br>

### Human Protein Multi Label Image Classification
[Project Link]() </br>
Classifying Human Protein using the microscopic images, where each image can have several classes present in it.gnii

### Handwritten Alphabet Recognizer with Keras
[Poster](https://github.com/adesh-gadge/Handwritten-Alphabet-Recognizer-/blob/master/Poster_IST707.pdf) <br/>
The data set comes from the Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition. The goal is to recognize digits 0 to 9 in
handwriting images.I have utilized naïve Bayes, kNN and SVM algorithms. Tuned their parameters to get the best model (measured by cross validation) and compared which algorithms provide better model for this task.

## Classification and Clustering Problems

### Hit or Miss?, Predicting if the song will be a popular or not!
[Project Link](https://github.com/adesh-gadge/Hit-or-Miss-Song-Popularity-Prediction) <br/>
Predicting if the song would be popular or not based on the audio features of the song. Song data was collected using Spotify API.

### Cluster Analysis(K-means, HAC) and Decision Tree Induction algorithm for finding the author of the disputed essays
[Link](https://github.com/adesh-gadge/Cluster-Analysis-K-means-HAC-and-Decision-Tree-Induction-algorithm) <br/>
Solving a mystery in history using Machine Learning with R: who wrote the disputed essays in the Federalist Papers, Hamilton or Madison?

### Student Performance Prediction 
[Project Link](https://github.com/adesh-gadge/Student_Performance_Predictions)</br> 
Predicting students academic performance using various factors such as class participation, resources visited, subject, attendance., etc
There are three categories of student classes: High/H, Low/L and Medium/M based on academic performance. </br> 
A kaggle dataset on student academic performance (available through https://www.kaggle.com/aljarah/xAPI-Edu-Data and also included as the attachment in this instruction) is gathered to identify the influential factors for students’ performance.

### Airline Customer Satisfaction Survey Analysis

## Regression Problems 
### Solving Regression Problem for Blogfeedback ( Predicting number of comments expected on a blog)
[Project Link](https://github.com/adesh-gadge/BlogFeedback-Regression-Problem) <br/>
Data Source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/BlogFeedback
Performed Least Square Regression, Ridge Regression and LASSO to predict the target variable <br/>
Tried to find what are the important features in the given data according to LASSO.
