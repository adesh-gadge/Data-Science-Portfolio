## Classification Problems
### Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!
This is a simple example of Logistic Regression Implementation using NumPy. It is based on Andrew Ng's Lecture on Coursera.
Halloween Special competition. We have some characteristics of monsters and the goal is to predict the type of monsters: ghouls, goblins or ghosts.

Solving a mystery in history using Machine Learning with R: who wrote the disputed essays in the Federalist Papers, Hamilton or Madison?

### Airline Customer Satisfaction Survey Analysis
Uncovering effects of features such as Age,Gender, Price Sensitivity,Food,Snacks or shopping on airports on the Custoemr Satisfaction on the flight journey using machine learning with R. <br/>

### Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition
The goal was to recognize digits 0 to 9 in handwriting images using K-NN, Naive Bayes Algorithm and Support Vector Machine. 


## Regression Problems 
### Bejing Housing Price Analysis using MS Excel:
Analyzed factors affecting the price of residential units in the Bejing Area using Statistical Analysis, Time-Series Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Confidence Interval and Regressions using MS Excel. </br>

## Neural Networks 

### Student Performance Prediction
[Link](https://github.com/adesh-gadge/Student_Performance_Predictions) </br>
Predicting students academic performance using various factors such as class participation, resources visited, subject, attendance., etc
There are three categories of student classes: High/H, Low/L and Medium/M based on academic performance.
A kaggle dataset on student academic performance (available through https://www.kaggle.com/aljarah/xAPI-Edu-Data and also included as the attachment in this instruction) is gathered to identify the influential factors for students’ performance.
 

### Handwritten Alphabet Recognizer with Keras
The data set comes from the Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition. The goal is to recognize digits 0 to 9 in
handwriting images.I have utilized naïve Bayes, kNN and SVM algorithms. Tuned their parameters to get the best model (measured by cross validation) and compared which algorithms provide better model for this task.
